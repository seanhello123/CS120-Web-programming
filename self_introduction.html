        I decided to enroll in a web programming class this summer due to my keen interest in web development and a desire to expand my
        skill set in software development. Web programming offers a dynamic and versatile platform for creating interactive and
        engaging online experiences. By mastering web programming, I aim to enhance my ability to build user-friendly and
        visually appealing websites and web applications. I think this would be an invaluable skillset for a software engineer career path. <br/><br />

    A list of my 3 favorite foods are as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>Dan Dan Noodles</li>
        <li>Kung Pao Chicken</li>
        <li>Pad Thai</li>
    </ol>
    My favorite restaurant is Chili Garden <a href="https://www.chilligardenonline.com/" target="_blank">link</a> which is a Chinese food restaurant not too far from Tufts. It offers very good Sichuan style Chinese food as well as the Chinese-American classics. I especially like their lunch special offers with reasonal prices.

    Dandan noodles, also known as Dan Dan noodles or Dandanmian, are a popular Chinese dish originating from Sichuan
    cuisine. It consists of a savory and spicy sauce served over noodles, typically wheat noodles like egg noodles or ramen. <br /> 
    To eat it, I like to use chopsticks or a fork to thoroughly mix the noodles and the sauce. This ensures that every strand of noodle is coated with the flavorful sauce. <br /> 
    Dan Dan noodles offer a balance of spicy, savory, and tangy flavors. As you eat, you'll experience the heat from the chili oil and Sichuan peppercorns, the richness from the sauce, and the umami from the minced pork and seasonings. Highly reccomended! </p>
